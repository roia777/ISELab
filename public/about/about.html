    In descriptive writing, the author does not tell the reader what was seen, felt, tested, smelled, or heard. Rather, he describes something that he experienced and, through his choice of words, makes it seem real. In other words, descriptive writing is vivid, colorful, and detailed.

    Bringing Words to Life
    Descriptive writing creates an impression in the reader's mind of an event, a place, a person, or thing. The writing will be such that it will set a mood or describe something in such detail that if the reader saw it, they would recognize it. Descriptive writing will bring words to life and makes the text interesting.

    Some examples of descriptive text include:

    The sunset filled the entire sky with the deep color of rubies, setting the clouds ablaze.
    The waves crashed and danced along the shore, moving up and down in a graceful and gentle rhythm like they were dancing.
    The painting was a field of flowers, with deep and rich blues and yellows atop vibrant green stems that seemed to beckon you to reach right in and pick them.
    The old man was stooped and bent, his back making the shape of a C and his head bent so far forward that his beard would nearly have touched his knobby knees had he been just a bit taller.
    His deep and soulful blue eyes were like the color of the ocean on the clearest day you can ever imagine.
    The soft fur of the dog felt like silk against my skin and her black coloring glistened as it absorbed the sunlight, reflecting it back as a perfect, deep, dark mirror.
    Descriptive Text in Literature
    Because descriptive text is so powerful, many examples of it can be found in famous literature and poetry.

    In this excerpt from Jamaica Inn by Daphne du Maurier, notice the writer's choice of adjectives, adverbs, and verbs.
